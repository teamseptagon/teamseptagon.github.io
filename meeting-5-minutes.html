<b>Old business:</b> What is a new idea for us to help Home Sweet Home besides just helping with their run. We talked about how we could get people to sign up for the run and document that it was us that told them about the run. We also looked at previous yearsâ€™ numbers for the Home Sweet Home run and was going to see if there was an increase in numbers compared to previous years. We also saw there was hardly anybody registered between the ages of 18 to 25 and thought we could help to get college students to do it.<br><br>

<b>New business:</b> We have heard back from Julie from Feet Fleet about the race and we have a meeting with her Friday March 3rd to discuss us promoting the race. We need to contact radio stations about advertising our race to the community. We also need to contact about advertising on campus.<br><br>

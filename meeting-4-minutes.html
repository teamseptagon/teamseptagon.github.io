    Historian (Nick D.): Nick has nothing new to report for historian role.<br>

<b>Old business:</b> We finished the logo and bios for the website. Complete the project proposal as a group at the meeting.<br><br>

<b>New business:</b> What is a new idea for us to help Home Sweet Home besides just helping with their run. We talked about how we could get people to sign up for the run and document that it was us that told them about the run. We also looked at pervious yearsâ€™ numbers for the Home Sweet Home run and was going to see if there was an increase in numbers compared to previous years. We also saw there was hardly anybody registered between the ages of 18 to 25 and thought we could help to get college students to do it.<br><br>

    Nathaniel: Upload Agenda and Minutes and bring note taking material. Also, figure out what it takes to reserve a spot to pass out flyer at Watterson Dining.<br>
    Josh: Talk to the basketball association about our run and see if they would like to get anyone to join it.<br>
    Nick D.: Start to think and design a flyer we could pass out to help get more participates to join the run for both the 5k and 10k.<br>
    Nick F.: Add the logo to the website before the next meeting.<br>

    <b>Everyone:</b> Brainstorm ideas for getting people for our run and flyer ideas. Also, think of alternative ideas if the run falls through.<br><br>

<b>Adjournment:</b> 6:10 pm
